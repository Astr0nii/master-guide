# Ratpoison

Ratpoision is a external legit cheat that was forked from charlatano(Which is also great external cheat that hasn't detected for a long time.), written in Java. It hasn't been detected for 3 years, and it's source is available at github. It is highly recommended to newcomers who don't have programming experience.

## Prerequisites
* Windows 7 or above (Overlay is only available on Windows 10)
* (Optional) Java Development Kit 13 [How to install JDK 13?](https://tubemint.com/install-java-jdk/)

## How to set up
Head up to [their github repository](https://github.com/TheFuckingRat/RatPoison/),

After you downloaded the zip file, unzip to a random folder, but we recommend that folder name should not have:
* spaces
* symbols that dosen't exist in ASCII table (No random words)

After you unzip it, you should be able to see the folder structure like this:

Click on build.bat.

After you click on build.bat, a command prompt window will show up, to ask about do uou have JDK installed. Type Y or N depending on whether you have the JDK (not the JRE). It will handle installing the JDK for you, then compile the cheat.

The cheat will then be in the \build\Ratpoison (version number)\ folder.

After you compiled the cheat, you need to run CSGO first, then run the .bat file inside the output folder mentioned above.

Since it is an external, but it binds to the csgo.exe window so the menu shows up on top. Also, the default menu key is F1.

We recommed load into the map [Aim Botz](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660) and try to mess around with the settings, until you find the best legit config that works best for you. If do can't set it up, we will make a basic legit config in a later section.
