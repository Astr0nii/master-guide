# Ratpoision

Ratpoison is a great free legit cheat that has been undetected for over 3 years, even though it hasn't been around that long (when you consider it's based on charlatano, which has existed for that long w/o bans)

Download zip, unzip it, run build.bat and type Y or N depending on whether you have the JDK (not the JRE). It will handle installing the JDK for you, then build the cheat. The cheat will then be in the /build/Ratpoison (version number)/ folder.
Open CSGO, then run the bat file. It is an external, but it binds to the csgo.exe window so the menu shows up on top. Also, the default menu key is F1.
Do not ask for a legit config. It is not difficult to create one yourself, not to mention everyone's idea of "legit" and what they personally want on and off in each cheat changes.
Load into this map (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660) and change the settings until you get it just the way you like it.
