# Legit Cheating

## Tips for closet legit players

Some features you should use:

#Radar hack
Radar hack is better than regular ESP because it allows you to expect players, but not exactly where they are.

#Sound ESP
Sound ESP is much better than regular ESP because you only see it if the player is making noise. This means you know a player is there, however don't peek directly onto their head because the sound isn't that precise and it can be blatant.

#Lose rounds!
Voluntarily die against bad players! In rounds where you're up by a handful, lose. In 14-14 rounds, it's okay to go a little harder. Lose unimportant rounds.

#Practice movement!
This is why people call you out most of the time. Silver movement, Global aim. Just hack barely enough to win at your rank. No more.
