##Closet

Closet cheating takes skill, before anyone dares to start closet cheating I suggest they first learn the mechanics of the game. Please do take time to learn crosshair placement, movement, recoil control, and a bit of gamesense.

##Peaking and Crosshair Placement

The definition of crosshair placement is when the player positions his/her crosshair to headshot level while peaking. It is crucial when trying to closet, since players can determine whether you are hacking or not. It takes a bit of time to memorise the placements in each corner and in each map, but after a few days of playing clean you will get the hang of it.

A tip when peaking an angle is to jiggle peak/shoulder peak. This type of peaking gives you info about the whereabouts of the player without exposing yourself to them. Also, when there is an AWPer scoped in and holding an angle, you can shoulder peak to trigger their shot, and when they do, peak properly and attack them while they are waiting for the AWP bullet to reload or switch to another pistol.

##Movement

Movement is important is general, but even more when closet cheating. 

Movement consists of two parts: Strafing, and bhopping (bunny hopping)

Strafing is the act of pressing the left/right keys on your keyboard (usually A and D) and moving your mouse in order to gain spead while mid air. The best way I would suggest improving your strafing skills is to hop in surfing servers and learn how to surf.
Bhopping is when the player jumps, and right before landing jumps again consistently without hitting the ground. Bhopping is usually used in order to gain speed, but in order to do so, the player must combine strafing and bhopping so that his or her speed will be consistent and fast. There are many bhop servers you can join, but the best way is to practice on offical servers.

Best way to practice movement is to movement in general is to play in kz servers.

##RCS and Recoil Control

When closeting, I highly advice you to not use RCS as it is very obvious to other players or overwatchers. There are many workshop maps that help you learn recoil patterns, and even cetrain cheat providers have a "recoil crosshair". But if you cannot do without rcs I suggest to go with:
*50.0 on X axis
*60.0 on Y axis
