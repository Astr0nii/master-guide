## Ezfrags

Ezfrags is not techinally a paste, but with it's high detection rate so just do not use it.

Plus we do not recommend people buying Ezfrag's premium subscription, since it is just the same as Ezfrag's free version, but ironicly it has a highly detection rate than the free version. So just stay away from both ezfrags plan.

## Project Infinty

Projecy infinty also has a free version, but since it has been idenitied as a paste, we do not recommend you to try it out.

## Controversial Section!

* This section describes a highly controversial event/item that may subject to change, you should NOT take this as an absolute reference. By reading the following section, you are agreeing that r/csgohacks and CSGO cheating masterguide contributors will not bear any reponsibility for any misleading information.

Zapped.cc is a highly controversial cheat provider that has been claimed to leaking it's user's ip address, causing user's online privacy might be compromised. Also according to [Boring](pastes-and-scams.md), a famous cheating youtuber, who has pointed out serval evidence about zapped that it is a scam. However since we cannot validate the accuracy of his sources, we are still unable to give a conclusion as of right now, but until then it will still be on the paste and scam list.
