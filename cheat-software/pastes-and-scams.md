## Ezfrags

Ezfrags is not techinally a paste, but with it's high detection rate so just do not use it.

Plus we do not recommend people buying Ezfrag's premium subscription, since it is just the same as Ezfrag's free version, but ironicly it has a highly detection rate than the free version. So just stay away from both ezfrags plan.

## Project Infinty

Projecy infinty also has a free version, but since it has been idenitied as a paste, we do not recommend you to try it out.

## Zappped
