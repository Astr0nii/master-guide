# Anti-Cheats

#VAC vs VACNET

VAC is an anti cheat. It detects cheats on your computer. It's generally not very secure.

VACNET is an "AI" system that can detect cheaters. It is generally only effective against spin botters. It recently had an update that stated there will be less spin botters in overwatch. Whether this means they will insta ban afterwards or it requires less confirmations, no one is sure.

#FACEIT server side

Faceit server side is less secure than client side. It detects anti aim, certain types of aimbot, and rage bot, and other manipulations like backtrack. However, many p2c's do indeed support server side; for example, skeet. Ratpoison is a free cheat that does as well.

#FACEIT client side

Faceit client side is incredibly hard and expensive to bypass correctly. Expect to spend several hundred monthly (and still no guarantee of 100% undetectedness) because this anti cheat is well written. Also, if they ban you for cheating on client side, they WILL analyze your computer and the info it sends back. Faceit is very intrusive by design and as such if a single player gets banned on client side, even if it's a manual overwatch-type ban, the cheat could be analyzed and everyone could get hit.
