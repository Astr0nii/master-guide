# Common mistakes when choosing a cheat software

When you choosing your first cheat in CSGO, you may feel confused with so many cheat providers out there, and don't know which cheat provider you should chooose first. This page aims to help you to choose about your first cheat.

## Internal vs External

Internal means the whole cheat is injected into the csgo process. No other window for the menu. Internals are more efficient, achieving more cheat featrures such as anti-aim \(Spinbot\). It has a active community on github, unknowncheats, and mpgh to research on internal cheats. However, the main programming language, C++ is difficult to learn from zero coding experience.\(at least personally! -2772\)

Externals are usually separate windows and can be slower. Almost always used only for legit cheats. It is limted to achive blatant features with it, and rage features are definitely impossible. Compared to internals, cheat developers can use more techniques against detection \(low ring for example\), easy to write for basic features compared to c++ \(again, personally -2772\). Hoever externals much less efficient since they can only modify CSGO's gameprocess by using win32 functions `OpenProcess()`,`ReadProcessMemory()` and `WriteProcessMemory()`, which can be laggy if not optimized properly.

Most common cheat providers are offering an internal cheat, due to their much better efficiency and constant accurate timing, which is crtical for HvH, meanwhile external is very delayed compared to internals.

What ISN'T different between the 2: detection is not easier or harder on internal or external. They are about the individual cheat.

## What shall I consider when choosing my first cheat?

This digram helps you to choose your first cheat by asking yourself various questions:

* Am I going to pay for a cheat?
* If I am going to pay for a cheat, how much I would spend on it?
* What kind of features do I want most? Legit cheating features, or with rage \(spinbot\) feature too?
* If I will not going to pay for a cheat, do I have programming experience to fix the public sources available?...etc

## Is x and y cheat good? Anyone heard about it?

We cannot cover all the cheat providers available in the market, maybe there is a new cheat is available right as you reading this guide. However as you, a newcomer, we still highly recommend to use some well-known cheat providers as your first cheat first, since it is way more stable, lesser detection proven through time, a large community that can help you to slove various problems.
