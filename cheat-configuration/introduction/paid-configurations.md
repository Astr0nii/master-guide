# Paid configurations

You may see lot's of famous youtubers are dominating in every hvh match, while you only barely killing a player. Then theese youtubers told you to join their membership to get access to their configs. You instantly join their membership, downloaded their config to your cheat......and nothing changed. You're still gettting killed by other players. You're wondering: why I am using the same config as them, but I can't get any improvements?

## Configurations does not represent anything
A good configutation can helps you to get more kills, but the most important is about your playstyle. You need both to to dominate the match. Also, there is a sad truth that you can't gurantee you are using the same configurations that the youtuber is using, which means they might selling a fake configuration to you. Even they are selling the same configuration as shown on their video, you are still having a chance to loose. It is bacause about the config might fit his playstyle, but not yours.
