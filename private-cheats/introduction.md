# Introduction

While there are public cheats available for general users to choose, but there are also some cheats decided to go private forvarious reasons.

## Advantages of staying private

* Lesser chances of being detected
* The community will be more friendly
* Making your cheat more famous, since not anyone can get one easily.

And here are some examples of private cheats.

## TODO section

## Skeet / Gamesense

\[TODO:Skeet logo+menu\] Gamesense.pub \(previously known as skeet.cc\) is a private cheat provider started from 2017. It is considered the top tier cheat provider in the CSGO cheating scene. The menu has been pointed as a standard for most startup cheat providers/self-coded cheats. It has an un-hittable Anti-Aim and a 'godlike' reslover back during it's release. Despite nowdays there are lost of both private and cheats started to comes up with gamesense, it's still the top cheat for CSGO. Invite only. \[TODO:Skeet unhittableaa\]

## Fatality

\[TODO:Fatality logo+menu\] Fatality.win is another private cheat provider started in 20xx. It is a HvH-focused cheat, which means it is lacking of legit features. It has a \[insert\] anti-aim and a \[insert\] reslover. Invite only, but sometimes inivtes are purchasable from offical moderators.

## Novolinehook

\[TODO:Novolinehook logo+menu\] Novolinehook.com is a german private cheat provider started in 2017. It is an excellent cheat if you are willing to closet, legit, or even semirage. It is mostly known for its ability to stay undetected, and has dodged many of the recent waves.   
This cheat is application only (although you can get invited by admins, but that is highly unlikley). The application process is fairly easy, not many get denied. You fill out an application on their forums and then get sent to do a teamspeak interview.   
Novoline also has a league, and a private vesion (Hook of Ra). League version supports VAC, SMAC, EAC, CEVO, ESL WIRE (unstable), and Faceit Serverside. Also, novolinehook has an amazing staff support, their hwid resets are almost instant, and staff are always friendly and helpful. My only real complaints are the shitty hvh features and lack of updates. [*Here is a review by mcguidelines*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_EJ7DoM27Y)


## Fanta

\[TODO:Fanata logo+menu\] Fanta.club is a Private legit cheat provider which mostly focuses on its semi-rage aspects. Its considered one of the best semirage cheats and is a competitor to novoline. It has had its fair share of detections, but performance wise its really good. Although its pasted (from gladiatorcheatz) the community is still strong and the devs are trying to rebuild the cheat.

## ev0lve

\[TODO:ev0lve logo+menu\] ev0lve.xyz is a german private cheat provider that started back in 20xx. It is a HvH based cheat as Fatality, however with few more legit features available. Application and invites are available, with limited application slots. TODO

## Rifk7

\[TODO:rifk7 logo+menu\] Rifk7 is a private HvH cheat. Specially to mention the loader will playes music when opening it. Invites purchasable from admin. TODO
