# Terminology of csgo cheating

Theese are the terms that are commomly used in the CSGO cheating community:

## Cheat Software-related
* P2C - Cheat software that requires the user to pay for it.

* F2C - Cheat software that don't requires the user to pay for it, mostly are external cheats.

* Paste - Cheat software that their source code are based on some open-source code that is available on popular code hosting websites such as github. However so most of them behaves quite bad and the chances of getting detected by anti-cheat software are very high. Also some scammers would use them as a base to scame people. 

However cheaters also used this term as an irony to their paid cheat behaves like those cheats. 

* Crack - Cheats that are used to be paid and now being accessible for free.

* Config - The configuration for the cheat. Most of the cheats in CSGO provides a lot of features for the user to set up. A configuration file will help the user to load up a pre-configurated cheat settings to the cheat, reduces the time to set up the cheat all over again.

* Lua/js - Some cheat providers also allows their community to create some scripts in order to let the cheat behave how the user-wanted. This could allow the user to make the cheat more flexible. Most of the scripts are written in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), however some cheat providers provide a [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) API, therefore there are also scripts are written in JavaScript (JS for short).

## Cheat feautres
 * Aimbot - An aimbot is a software tool that allow the player to shoot enemies without having to aim their weapon. In most cheat software theere are two types of aimbot: Legit and rage aimbot. The legitaimbot will also provide a smoothing function, which determines the speed of the aimbot moves the aim to the enemy's head. As for a rage aimbot, it just behaves like how a general aimbot does, snaps to the enemy's head instantly.

 * Triggerbot - Helps you to shoot towards an enemy when the enemy is located at cheater's crosshair. Usually comes with a delay function to let the user choose the delay of the triggerbot will shoot.

 * Hitbox priority - In general, a playermodel hitbox is divided into different parts to the playermodel, in order to calculate the damage from the player

 * Recoil Control System (RCS) - Helps you control the recoil of the gun. Some cheats also comes with a standlone RCS, what it means the RCS will not affected by the aimbot.

 * Anti-Aim (AA) - As known as "Spinbot" by normal CS players. In CSGO, a viewangle is made form 3 basic elements:
    * Pitch (Rotation along the X axis)
    * Yaw   (Rotation along the Y axis)
    * Roll  (Rotation along the Z axis)

As we mentioned before, the way aimbot (What we are talking about here is rage aimbot) works is by moving your crosshair to the enemy's head. So how anti-aim works, is to modify the angle of the playermodel's head by editing the values in pitch, yaw or roll, so that the aimbot will need to calculate the angle of the enemy's head, causing the chances of getting hit will be lower. One of the popular anti-aim, which is used to be spinbot, is achieved by modifying the yaw angle from -180 to 180 in one second, causing the playermodel looks like spinning. However nowdays the most common type of anti-aim are emotion (45 degrees) on pitch with static desync or jitter.

 * Legit Anti-Aim -  Legit anti-aim is slimar to anti-aim, but with a smaller angle. It is a chieved by using desync to a maxium  of 58 degrees. Thus the playermodel will still looks like normal, but the real hitbox is being shifted to a different angle. Also, most cheat provides also using a LBY breaker in order to achive a 118 degrees of legit anti-aim.

 * Slient aim - Slient aims wil allows you to freely moves your character without looks like snapping your corsshair into the enmeny's head instantly. In the past, there is also a server-side slient-aim, which means other players will also see you are not snaping into other player's head. However that was patched, and now there is only client-side slient aim available, which means in overwatch or demo, they will see you snaps into other player's head instantly.

 * Spread / NoSpread - All weapons have spread in CSGO. So what nospread does is to removing all the bullet spread in the game, no matter when you are jumping, walking or running. It is only available in commnity servers.

 * LBY - A short term for lower body yaw.

 * Desync - 

 * Reslover - 

 * Backtrack - An exploit which allows you to shoot at where a certain player was and still hit them. Usually is configured in ticks or ms, with a maximum of 200ms.
 
 In CSGO, in order to reduce latency between client and the server, a tick system is designed. What is does is the client will collect all the local data, compressed it as a tick and send it to the server. Then the server collects the ticks from different client in a specificed time limit (which is 64 tick in offical valve servers while some community server servers will set to 128 tick.), then send the calculated result to the clients. Thus the client is always serval ticks ahead from the server, the tick which is used to determine the hitbox is the first tick chocked from the client. And what backtrack does is by boradcasting a history recorded tick to the server. This is also used in fake angles, which is achieved by boradcasting a fake tick to other client from the server, however this is patched in 2018.

 * FakeLag - Which will let the players looks like freezing bewteen frames. It works slimar to using a lag switch, in order to not let other players 

 * FOV - Short term for "Field Of View". Which is a feature for the aimbot to dertime the FOV range should the aimbot active.

 * Fast stop - exploit allowing a quicker stop from walking.

 * Fast duck/unlimited duck - exploit that breaks crouch stamina

 * Name stealer - Which will allows the player to steal other player's name, so that the player will not getting kicked out. Mostly useful when a cheater is raging in casual gamemodes or community servers.
