# Game Bans

There are serval types of game ban in CSGO :

## VAC

Mostly happens when using a detected cheat. These kind of bans are permanent, and you lose your inventory and cannot play matchmaking. HVH servers are fine though.

## Overwatch Ban

Overwatch bans are manual bans where players watch your demos and ban you.

## Griefing ban

Griefing bans are overwatch bans that are "minor", will last 30 days the first time, but will turn permenant if you get it twice.

## Untrusted

Untrusted bans are akin to a vac ban; permanent and skins are locked. Most cheats don't have untrusted bans.
